Project Title: NeuroGraph – A Neuro-Symbolic Active Inference AgentOverview:This project implements a cognitive architecture that combines symbolic AI (Knowledge Graphs) with neural networks (Google Gemini API). Unlike static databases or purely statistical LLMs, this agent starts as a Tabula Rasa (blank slate) and autonomously constructs a semantic worldview through interaction, recursive questioning, and "dreaming."Key Features & Mechanisms:Tabula Rasa & Active Grounding:The system begins with zero knowledge.Recursive Inquiry: When the agent encounters an unknown concept in user input, it halts processing to perform "Grounding." It queries the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API to define the concept (e.g., "What is an Apple?" -> "Fruit"). This recursion continues until the agent reaches a known fundamental concept or an "Unknown" state.Grammar-Agnostic Parsing:Instead of relying on rigid NLP libraries, the agent uses a heuristic parser based on capitalization and position to identify Objects (nouns), States (verbs), and Properties (adjectives) from natural language input (S-V-O structure).Fluid Cluster Mathematics (The "Physics" of the Brain):Decoupling (Cell Division): When a high-priority concept forms a new connection, it splits its "energy" (priority). A new child node is created based on the formula: $P_{child} = (P_{parent} / N_{connections}) + 1$. This prevents concept dilution while enabling specialization.Merging (Synaptic Fusion): The system continuously scans for redundant nodes within the same label group. If two nodes share identical priority values (within a tolerance), they merge into a single super-node, summing their priorities.Dreaming & Memory Consolidation:Offline Replay: During idle states (after processing input), the agent enters a "Dream Mode." It generates random, hypothetical connections (grey edges) between existing nodes.Heuristic Confirmation: If future real-world input confirms a "dreamed" connection, the edge transforms into a Gold Edge, and its priority is boosted significantly (+2.0). This simulates the biological process of intuition and long-term memory consolidation.Dynamic Visualization:Uses NetworkX and Matplotlib to render the brain in real-time.Community Detection: Applies modularity algorithms to automatically color-code semantic clusters (e.g., nature concepts vs. physics concepts).Visual Priority: Node size and color intensity (Blue $\to$ Red $\to$ Gold) represent the learned importance of specific concepts.Tech Stack:Language: PythonCore Logic: NetworkX (Graph Theory)LLM Integration: Google Generative AI SDK (Gemini 1.5 Flash)Visualization: Matplotlib (Real-time plotting)
